This repository is a **reproducible serving recipe and benchmark harness** for
`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` on one 192 GB-class gfx942 GPU. The primary
workload is a **long-lived coding agent**: large stable prefix, growing multi-turn
history, streaming tool calls, mixed cold/hot requests, and a required ~500K
context ceiling.

The patch source is pinned by full commit SHA, the runtime is audited after
restart, and performance changes are accepted only after end-to-end agent and
correctness gates, not from a single tokens/s microbenchmark.

## Validated local baseline

Measured on the MI308X profile in [`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md):

| Metric | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Configured context ceiling | **524,288 tokens** |
| Long-context ladder | **50K / 128K / 256K / 384K / 500K all pass** |
| 512-token generation incl. TTFT | **141.8 tok/s** on the promoted 3072 profile |
| C1 / C2 / C4 / C8 aggregate | **129.2 / 235.8 / 375.0 / 549.6 tok/s** |
| High-batch K7 C32 / C64 aggregate | **730.2 / 914.6 tok/s** on the indexed 256-token fixture |
| 500K ladder wall time | **77.3s** at 3072; **75.3s** at the 4096 throughput profile |
| 30-turn per-request prefix-cache hit | **95.46%** (1,027,596 / 1,076,518 prompt tokens) |
| Ordinary hot coding-agent TTFT | **~0.23–0.38s** in the 3072 promotion trace |
| Auto tool-call validation | **100K 5/5, 200K 3/3, 100K C4 16/16**, no raw DSML leakage |
| Cold 200K-prefill isolation | **+1.30 / +1.33 / +1.41s** at 3072; still above the +0.5s gate |
| Same-instance staged model load | **~36–43s** after local SSD/page-cache warm-up (169.7s original NFS control) |

The performance profile now includes **MI308X-specific 80-CU AITER tables**
(see [`tuning/README.md`](tuning/README.md)).
The complete 2026-08-16 experiment trail, including rejected candidates and raw
operator/service numbers, is recorded in [`docs/TUNING_LOG_2026-08-16.md`](docs/TUNING_LOG_2026-08-16.md).
Correctness/tool/context gates pass; cold long-prefill tail-latency isolation is
still an open scheduler problem and is intentionally reported as such rather than
hidden by prefix-cache-warmed measurements.

## Stable runtime provenance

```text
GPU        MI308X / MI300X class, gfx942, 192 GB
ROCm       7.2.3
Python     3.12
Torch      2.11.0+gitd0c8b1f (platform ROCm build, reused)
vLLM       0.26.1rc1.dev306+gcb8104839.rocm723
AITER      0.1.19

           012b9945c1e61ec7a7c7de12da58e8c7cafd92ab
```

As of **2026-08-16**, that patch-source SHA is also the current upstream
`ryanzhou/deepseek-v4-flash-mi300x` `main` commit. The serving runtimes are still
not byte-identical:

```text
ryanzhou production: vLLM dev229 + AITER 0.1.19
this recipe:         vLLM dev306 + AITER 0.1.19
                     + activation=None compatibility edit for dev306
                     + local sandbox madvise fallback patch
```

Pinning the full source SHA remains important: a future branch move must not
silently change a reproducible install.

## Why gfx942 needs a dedicated recipe

DeepSeek-V4-Flash combines sparse MLA, MXFP4 experts, FP8/FNUZ-sensitive paths,
DeepSeek-specific speculative decoding and long-context hybrid KV behavior. The
validated gfx942 stack includes fixes/tuning for deterministic sparse top-k,
ROCm DSpark verification, expert routing/SwiGLU correctness, sparse prefill,
AITER GEMM shapes, block-table overhead and native CPU-KV synchronization.

The primary upstream reference is
[ryanzhou/deepseek-v4-flash-mi300x](https://github.com/ryanzhou/deepseek-v4-flash-mi300x).
This project ports that source stack to a **native Docker-less dev306 venv** and
adds restart recovery, provenance auditing, 500K-class validation, coding-agent
benchmarks and sandbox-specific compatibility. MI308X is not treated as an
MI300X alias: both are gfx942, but this host reports **80 CUs** while the inherited
MI300X AITER tables are keyed for **304 CUs**. The launcher therefore detects the
AITER `(gfx, cu_num)` key and selects the repository's measured 80-CU tables.

## Quick start

### 0. Verify the environment

```bash
bash scripts/00_check_env.sh
```

Reports the ROCm/torch versions, the detected AITER `(gfx, cu_num)` key, wheel and
model-shard presence, and disk headroom. Fix failures here before paying for GPU
time.

### 1. Pin the patch source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeliciousBuding/deepseek-v4-flash-mi308x.git
cd deepseek-v4-flash-mi308x
bash scripts/prepare_patch_repo.sh
```

`prepare_patch_repo.sh` fetches the exact full SHA above and checks the files
required by the installer.

### 2. Create the isolated venv

```bash
bash scripts/env_setup.sh
```

The venv uses `--system-site-packages` so the platform ROCm Torch build is reused
rather than replaced. System Python/Torch remain untouched.

### 3. Install the pinned serving runtime

Place the exact vLLM/AITER/flydsl wheels under `$WHEELS` (see the environment
table below), then:

```bash
bash scripts/install_vllm_nightly.sh
```

The installer refuses to proceed if the patch checkout is not at the expected
full SHA. It applies the overlays, validates artifacts, and persists venv/AITER
snapshots for restart recovery.

### 4. Download the model

```bash
bash scripts/01_download_model.sh dsflash
```

The serve path checks for all **48 weight shards** before launch.

### 5. Audit and serve

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_runtime.py

# Optional but strongly recommended on a GPU session: make an ephemeral local-SSD
# hot copy. The launcher auto-prefers it only when all 48 shards validate.
bash scripts/stage_model_local.sh dsflash

# Optional but recommended outside an already protected private network. The
# same environment variable is consumed by the benchmark clients.
export VLLM_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/vllm_api_key

bash scripts/02_serve_vllm.sh dsflash

# In a second shell after /health is ready, cover real first-use JIT paths and
# persist the validated production venv + compiler caches.
SNAPSHOT_AFTER_WARMUP=1 bash scripts/warmup_runtime.sh
```

`audit_runtime.py` verifies the runtime versions, patch-source revision,
installed overlays, patched C++ extension, sparse-prefill artifact and restart
snapshots. Runtime-generated AITER, torch-extension, ROCm COMGR and Triton caches
are warm-start accelerators. `warmup_runtime.sh` covers representative first-use
paths; `snapshot_runtime_state.sh` atomically replaces the production venv
snapshot and persists all warm caches.

### 6. Verify the server and run a benchmark

```bash
# In a second shell once the server reports /health ready:
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health

# One-shot coding-agent benchmark (30 turns, 20K-token prefix):
python3 scripts/bench/bench_agent_trace.py 30 20000
```

The health endpoint returns JSON including engine status. For the full benchmark
suite and the expected baselines, see [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).
The same flow is also available as an executable Jupyter notebook:
[`notebooks/mi308x_deploy_bench.ipynb`](notebooks/mi308x_deploy_bench.ipynb).

## CPU-instance preparation

If CPU/GPU instances share persistent storage, finish the cheap work first:

```bash
bash scripts/preflight_cpu.sh
```

It checks shell/Python syntax, pins the upstream source SHA, verifies 48/48 model
shards, validates exact vLLM/AITER/flydsl wheel archives, checks persistent
venv/JIT/AITER snapshots, and reports storage headroom. A CPU-preflight failure
should be fixed **before paying for GPU time**.

## Stable launch profile

```text
--max-model-len 524288
--kv-cache-dtype fp8_ds_mla
--block-size 256
--enable-prefix-caching
--kv-cache-memory-bytes 16000000000
--kv-offloading-size 12
--kv-offloading-backend native
--max-num-seqs 64
--max-num-batched-tokens 3072
--long-prefill-token-threshold 1024
--moe-backend triton
--enable-expert-parallel
--tokenizer-mode deepseek_v4
--reasoning-parser deepseek_v4
--tool-call-parser deepseek_v4
--enable-auto-tool-choice
--enable-prompt-tokens-details
DSpark: K=7, probabilistic drafting, block rejection
--gpu-memory-utilization 0.95
```

The 12 GB native CPU-KV tier is a host constraint, not a general recommendation:
the validated sandbox exposes only a 16 GB `/dev/shm`.

### A/B without editing the launcher

```bash
MAX_MODEL_LEN=524288
MAX_NUM_SEQS=64
MAX_BATCHED_TOKENS=3072
LONG_PREFILL_TOKEN_THRESHOLD=1024
DSPARK_ENABLED=1
DSPARK_K=7
KV_OFFLOAD_GB=12
KV_CACHE_BYTES=16000000000
GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.95
MOE_BACKEND=triton
```

Examples:

```bash
# Native decoder control
DSPARK_ENABLED=0 bash scripts/02_serve_vllm.sh dsflash

# Throughput profile: ~2.7% faster at the measured 500K endpoint, but worse
# true-cold late-short-request isolation than the 3072 default.
MAX_BATCHED_TOKENS=4096 bash scripts/02_serve_vllm.sh dsflash
```

The default is the measured **3072 coding-agent latency profile**. 4096 remains
an explicit throughput profile; 2048 was rejected because it slowed the long
prefill more while giving unstable isolation results.

## Environment variables

All instance-specific paths are overridable. The defaults below are placeholders;
the scripts use a reference-sandbox layout that you override for your own
environment.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MODEL_BASE` | `<persistent-storage>/models` | checkpoint directory (48 shards) |
| `HOT_MODEL_BASE` | `<local-ssd>/models` | optional local-SSD hot copy |
| `WHEELS` | `<persistent-storage>/wheels` | pinned vLLM/AITER/flydsl wheels |
| `PATCH_REPO` | `<persistent-storage>/deepseek-v4-flash-mi300x` | pinned patch-source checkout |
| `PERSIST_DIR` | `<persistent-storage>/.venvs` | venv/JIT/AITER snapshots |
| `VLLM_VENV` | `<local-disk>/.venvs/vllm` | active serving venv |
| `VLLM_API_KEY` / `VLLM_API_KEY_FILE` | *(unset)* | optional serving/client auth |
| `VLLM_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | benchmark client endpoint |

The scheduler/decoder A/B knobs are listed under "A/B without editing the
launcher" above.

## Coding-agent benchmark suite

```text
scripts/bench/
├── bench_full.py                  decode/prefill/cache/context suite
├── bench_latency.py               TTFT / decode latency fixture
├── bench_agent_trace.py           one growing agent; per-request cache accounting
├── bench_session_concurrency.py   N independent long-lived agent histories
├── bench_high_concurrency.py      clean C32/C64 DSpark-vs-native boundary
├── bench_configured_ceiling.py    cold 8K/32K/100K MAX_MODEL_LEN comparison
├── bench_long_context_recall.py   exact multi-needle 100K-475K recall
├── bench_tool_roundtrip.py        streamed tool call -> tool result -> final answer
├── bench_ttft_isolation.py        short request injected during long prefill
└── collect_shapes.py              runtime/GEMM shape helper
```

Important benchmark semantics:

- cache hit attribution uses each response's
  `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`;
- global Prometheus cache counters are diagnostic only under concurrent traffic;
- hidden `reasoning_content` is **not** replayed into history by default;
  `--include-reasoning-history` provides the explicit comparison;
- performance traces never forge an orphan `role=tool` message;
- actual tool protocol is tested by `bench_tool_roundtrip.py`, including
  `forced` / `required` / `auto`, long prefixes and concurrent streaming.

Examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/bench/bench_agent_trace.py 30 20000
python3 scripts/bench/bench_session_concurrency.py --sessions 4 --rounds 8
python3 scripts/bench/bench_high_concurrency.py --concurrencies 32 64
python3 scripts/bench/bench_tool_roundtrip.py --mode auto --prefix-tokens 100000 --rounds 10
python3 scripts/bench/bench_tool_roundtrip.py --mode auto --prefix-tokens 100000 --rounds 16 --concurrency 4
```

## 500K context is an upper bound, not a per-request reservation

`--max-model-len 524288` does not make every short request consume 512K worth of
KV blocks. Paged KV/cache blocks are used as requests actually grow. A larger
configured bound can still influence planner/scheduler/admission structures, so
the GPU validation plan explicitly A/Bs 256K / 384K / 512K ceilings on identical
short requests instead of assuming the larger ceiling is completely free.

The product requirement remains: **allow approximately 500K context while
preserving short-request latency and concurrency as much as possible.**

## Prefix caching for coding agents

Cache identity comes from token-prefix blocks, **not conversation IDs**. Keep
stable material first:

```text
system instructions
-> stable tool schemas
-> repository / AGENTS.md / policy context
-> growing conversation
-> newest environment/tool output
```

Avoid timestamps, random request IDs, unstable JSON serialization, or reordered
tool schemas near the front. For untrusted multi-tenant sharing, use a per-trust-
group `cache_salt` to isolate prefix reuse.

## Current upstream comparison

Current upstream `main` is the same pinned source commit. Its production README
reports:

| Metric | Upstream production |
| --- | ---: |
| Runtime | vLLM dev229 + AITER 0.1.19 |
| Uncached C1 prefill | **11.69K tok/s steady** (11.53K median) |
| Static DSpark-7 C1 | 152.6 aggregate / **158.8 median per stream** |
| Native C1 | 67.3 aggregate |
| C64 K7 burst | **1,278 aggregate** |
| Context | **384K validated** (architecture supports 1M) |
| KV | 16 GB GPU + 96 GiB native CPU tier |
| Scheduler | 4096 budget; 384 reserved for spec, up to 3712 ordinary prefill |

These are reference points, not a direct transplant target. Our runtime base,
CPU-KV capacity and ~500K context requirement differ.

## Known issue-aware validation

The next GPU session explicitly tests failure classes currently reported in vLLM:
long-context DeepSeek-V4 DSML tool-call leakage, parser corruption under concurrent
streaming, DSpark hybrid-prefix-cache interactions, and speculative decoding
becoming throughput-negative at high batch size.

See [`docs/GPU_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](docs/GPU_VALIDATION_PLAN.md) for the ordered
correctness/performance matrix.

## Rejected experiments on dev306

Two FULL_AND_PIECEWISE graph-capture experiments were slower on this pinned
runtime, including a second pass extended through the 4096-token chunk size,
while consuming additional HBM/startup time. DSpark K=5 also lost to K=7 for the
measured single-stream path. Do not repeat those exact tests unless the runtime
or kernel stack changes.
